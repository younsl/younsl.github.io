## Hi 

Alexander Younsung Lee is a [DevOps Engineer](https://roadmap.sh/devops) based in Seoul with a System Engineer background.

I've been using Rust as my main language since October 2025. I follow the Unix way: ["Do One Thing and Do It Well."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) I focus on building tools that solve one problem really well instead of trying to do everything.

I'm interested in Kubernetes and building tools that automate operations with containers.

You can check out my operations automation tools at [o](https://github.com/younsl/o) (Operation Essentials) and open-source Helm charts at [younsl/charts](https://github.com/younsl/charts).
