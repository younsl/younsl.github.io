# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Hugo-based personal tech blog and Helm chart repository hosted at younsl.github.io. It serves dual purposes:
- Personal tech blog at [younsl.github.io](https://younsl.github.io)
- Helm chart repository at [younsl.github.io/charts](https://younsl.github.io/charts)

## Architecture

### Hugo Site Structure
- **hugo.yaml**: Main Hugo configuration file
- **content/**: Site content organized by type
  - `blog/`: Blog posts (each in its own directory with `index.md` and assets)
  - `about/`: About page content
  - `charts/`: Helm charts and chart repository files
  - `slides/`: Presentation slides using Marp/Slidev
- **themes/void/**: Custom Hugo theme (minimalistic, content-first design)
- **static/**: Static assets served directly
- **public/**: Generated site output (git-ignored in development)

### Theme Architecture
The site uses a custom Hugo theme called "void" located in `themes/void/`. This theme follows Hugo's standard layout structure with custom SCSS and JavaScript components for a minimalistic design.

## Development Commands

### Hugo Site Development
```bash
# Serve site locally for development
hugo server

# Serve in production mode for testing
hugo server --environment production --theme void

# Build static site
hugo

# Build with specific environment
hugo --environment production --minify

# Build and serve using Docker (alternative local development)
podman build -t hugo-blog .
podman run --rm -p 1313:1313 -v $(pwd):/app hugo-blog
```

### Presentation Slides
```bash
# Serve presentations with live reload (uses Podman/Docker)
cd content/slides
make serve

# Build all presentations to PDF
make build

# Preview build without generating files
make build-dry-run

# Clean generated PDFs
make clean
```

### Helm Chart Management
```bash
# Package and release a new chart
cd content/charts
./cr.sh
# Script will prompt for chart name and handle:
# 1. Chart validation with helm lint
# 2. Chart packaging
# 3. Repository index update
# 4. Moving files to correct locations
```

## Content Management

### Blog Posts
- Each blog post lives in `content/blog/{post-name}/`
- Contains `index.md` with frontmatter and content
- Images and assets stored alongside in same directory
- Posts automatically appear in chronological order

### Charts Repository
- Helm charts stored in `content/charts/`
- Chart packages (`.tgz` files) served directly
- Repository index managed via `cr.sh` script
- Index files synchronized between `content/charts/` and `static/`

### Presentations
- Located in `content/slides/{presentation-name}/`
- Uses Marp for PDF generation via containerized environment
- Source files named `slide-deck.md`
- Automated build process converts to PDF format

## Configuration Notes

### Hugo Configuration
- Minimum Hugo version: 0.144.0 (extended)
- Theme: void (custom, included in repository)
- Markdown renderer: Goldmark with custom settings
- Syntax highlighting: Built-in with `rrt` style
- Robot.txt and sitemap generation enabled

### Theme Features
- Dark appearance by default
- Minimal footer and navigation
- Support for mathematical expressions via MathJax
- Mermaid diagram support
- Custom shortcodes for enhanced content

### Content Filtering
- Slides directory `.md` files ignored during Hugo build
- Slide assets filtered from Hugo processing
- Clear separation between blog content and presentation content

## Important Development Guidelines

### File Management
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested
- When working with Helm charts, use the existing `cr.sh` script for packaging and releasing

### Markdown Formatting Rules
- All headers (#, ##, ###, ####, #####, ######) must be followed by exactly one blank line
- Never place content directly after a header without a blank line
- Maintain consistent spacing for better readability

### Chart Release Process
The `cr.sh` script in `content/charts/` automates the complete chart release workflow:
1. Validates chart with `helm lint`
2. Packages chart to `.tgz` file
3. Updates repository index
4. Synchronizes index between `content/charts/` and `static/` directories

## Deployment and CI/CD

### GitHub Actions
The repository uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment:
- **Deploy workflow**: Triggers on pushes to `main` branch, builds Hugo site with production settings
- **Hugo version**: 0.144.0 (extended) is used in CI/CD pipeline
- **Build process**: Includes minification and optimized asset handling
- **Target**: Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically

### Container Support
- Dockerfile provided for containerized local development
- Uses Alpine Linux base with Hugo extended binary
- Supports both Podman and Docker container engines
- Default port: 1313 for local development server
